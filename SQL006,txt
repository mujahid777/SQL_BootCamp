--- Write a query to print the name of department along with the total salary paid in each department

   --- Normal approach
select d.dept_name, tmp.total_salary
from (select dept_id, sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id) tmp
inner join department d on tmp.dept_id = d.dept_id;

--- How to do it using with clause

with dept_wise_salary as (select dept_id, sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id)

select d.dept_name, tmp.total_salary
from (select dept_id, sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id) tmp
inner join department d on tmp.dept_id = d.dept_id;

select * from dept_wise_salary;
