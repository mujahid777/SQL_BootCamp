SELECT * from orders_data;

--- Use of Having clause
--- write a query to find the country where only 1 order was placed
select country from orders_data group by country Having count(*)=1;

--- Where clause and group by clause -> what should be the proper sequence?
--- Answer -> where clause and then group BY

--- How to use GROUP_CONCAT
--- Query -> Write a query to print DISTINCT states present in the dataset for each country

SELECT country, GROUP_CONCAT(state) as states_in_country from orders_data group by country;
SELECT country, GROUP_CONCAT(distinct state) as states_in_country from orders_data group by country;

SELECT country, GROUP_CONCAT(distinct state order by state desc) as states_in_country from orders_data group by country;

--- Write a query to print all those employee records who are getting more salary then "ali"
--- wrong way -> select salary from employees where salary > 6500;
